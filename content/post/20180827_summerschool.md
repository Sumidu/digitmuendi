From August 13 to 17, Laura Burbach participated in the ESSA Summer School in Social Simulation: „Models in the real world“. She received insights in the linking of Agent-Based Models with empirical data and in the way how agents and their decisions and behaviours as well as their environment can be modelled in different kinds (very simple models vs. complex models) of ABMs. Furthermore, she attended many interesting talks and connected with people who are working with ABM as well.
