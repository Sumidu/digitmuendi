From September 17 to 21 Laura Burbach participated in the 4th Aachen International Summer School. Interesting Topic of the Summer School was „Introduction to Structure Equation  Models (SEM) and Measurement Theory„.  Laura learned much about the basics of designing, estimation and interpretation of SEM-models and how to build a SEM-model with the software LISREL.
